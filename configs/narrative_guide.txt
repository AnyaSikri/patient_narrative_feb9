**Study C-935788-061**

## NARRATIVE STRUCTURE

### Paragraph 1: Demographics & Medical History
**Required Elements:**
- Demographic information
- COVID-19 hospitalization status
- Medical history

**Conventions:**
- Medical history: Order by clinical relevance to the SAE/WAE
- Add medical history onset date ONLY if directly relevant to the case

### Paragraph 2: Concomitant Medications
**Required Elements:**
- Concomitant medications at the time of randomization

### Paragraph 3: Study Drug Dosing
**Required Elements:**
- Study drug dosing leading up to the SAE/WAE onset

**Critical Rules:**
- ❌ **DO NOT SAY:** "last dose"
- ✅ **USE INSTEAD:** "most recent dose"
- For multi-event narratives, state: "…prior to the [first event] [first and second events] [both events] [all 3/4/etc events]…"

### Event Description Paragraphs
**Required Elements:**
- Event term
- Event severity
- Event onset/stop dates
- Event outcome
- Study drug action taken and relevant dose adjustments
- Study drug relationship and other etiology per the Investigator

## TERMINOLOGY RULES

### Event Terms
**Rule:** Use Preferred Terms (PT) consistently throughout the narrative.

**Special Case:** If the Verbatim Term (VT) is more specific than the PT, add the VT parenthetically after the PT consistently throughout.

**Example:** "…cardiac failure (worsening cardiac failure)…"

### Study Day Numbers
**Rule:** Add Study Day # after the calendar date ONLY for these 3 dates:
1. SAE/WAE onset date
2. SAE/WAE stop date
3. Study drug dosing dates

### Dose at Event Onset
**Rule:** Add the dose at event onset ONLY if needed for clarity.

**Format:** "On [date], while receiving study drug at [dose], the subject experienced the SAE/WAE of xxx"

## REQUIRED SENTENCE TEMPLATES

### Hospitalization Events

#### Template 1: Development + Hospitalization
✅ **CORRECT:**
"On [date], the subject developed [symptoms] and was hospitalized due to the SAE of [event term]."

❌ **INCORRECT:**
"On [date], the subject experienced the SAE of xxx, which required hospitalization and was associated with [symptoms]."

#### Template 2: Hospitalization + Presentation
✅ **CORRECT:**
"On [date], the subject was hospitalized due to the SAE of [event term]. The subject presented with [symptoms]."

#### Template 3: Fatal Event
✅ **CORRECT:**
"On [date], the subject was hospitalized for the fatal SAE of [event term]."

#### Template 4: Medically Significant
✅ **CORRECT:**
"On [date], the subject developed the medically significant SAE of [event term]."

#### Template 5: Prolonged Hospitalization
✅ **CORRECT:**
"On [date], the subject experienced the SAE of [event term], which prolonged hospitalization."

### Dechallenge/Rechallenge Statements
**Critical Rule:** Use past perfect verb tense for SAE events

#### Interrupted + Restarted
✅ **CORRECT:**
"Study drug dosing had been interrupted due to the SAE of [event term]; the event abated after study drug was held. The event did not reoccur after study drug was restarted."

#### Permanently Discontinued
✅ **CORRECT:**
"Study drug dosing had been permanently discontinued due to the SAE of [event term]; the event abated after study drug was stopped."

### Not Applicable Drug Action
✅ **CORRECT:**
"The action taken with study drug due to the SAE of [event term] was considered not applicable."

## PROHIBITED PHRASES & CORRECTIONS

| ❌ DO NOT SAY | ✅ SAY INSTEAD |
|---------------|----------------|
| "last dose" | "most recent dose" |
| "subject presented with [workup results]" | "subject presented with [symptoms]" |
| "were not considered clinically significant" | "were considered not clinically significant" |
| "resolved with sequelae (not specified)" | "resolved with sequelae (sequelae not specified)" |

## PRESENTATION RULE: Symptoms vs. Workup Results

**Rule:** Clearly distinguish symptoms from workup/test results.

## LABORATORY VALUES

### Reference Ranges
**Rule:** Insert laboratory normal ranges ONLY at first mention of each laboratory value.

**If range not reported:**
"…(reference range[s] not provided)."

### Weight Gain
**Rule:** Include actual weight followed parenthetically by the rate of weight gain.

**Example:** "136 kg (1.3 kg in 8 days)" or "weight gain of 4 kg (4 kg in 2 days)"

## ABBREVIATIONS

### General Rule
- Treat each narrative as a standalone document when applying abbreviations at first use
- Define abbreviations at first use

### Common Abbreviations (NO definition needed)
Do NOT define these common abbreviations:
- CT, MRI, IV, PO, QD, BID, ECG, ER

## SPECIAL NOTES BY EVENT TYPE

### Infection Events
**Required Elements:**
- Include WBC (white blood cell count)
- Include absolute neutrophil count

**Note:** % neutrophils are not as clinically relevant (do not include)

### Liver Events
**Required Elements:**
- Include calculations for >xx × ULN for elevated LFT values
- Include x.x × Baseline at SAE/WAE onset ONLY if the Baseline LFT value is above ULN

## DATA VERIFICATION RULES

### Event Recurrence
**Critical Rule:** Do not automatically trust the MedWatch if it says "It is unknown if the event reoccurred after study drug was restarted."

**Action Required:** Check the AE listing to confirm whether the event reoccurred or not.
